# Flexible-Reward-System

Nowadays, rewards and cash backs have become effective ways of incentivising
shopping for the customers and have contributed to the humongous rise in users of
mobile/web apps providing these. But there is a need of maintaining flexibility in
such systems so that the administrator of such app could come up with different
offers and renumerations. Also, the system must be self sufficient in a way that all
the information regarding the user transactions are updated in all modules of the
program.
Our project implements such a flexible reward system. The application will be
hosted on the web and will keep track of all transactions in database tables. The
transactions will be then evaluated for any offers and the user wallet will be credited
with some amount of which he/she could redeem certain sums.
This is a prototype which will be implemented in PHP-MySQL environment but can
be further developed into a full-fledged application in the future.
